# Node Operators Endpoint Mapping Contract

This is a contract used by node operators to register their node.

Projects when choosing a node operator will have to choose it from the registered nodes
on the pNetwork DAO and then:

 1. Check the node has an endpoint registered within this contract
 2. Check the node attestation is valid
